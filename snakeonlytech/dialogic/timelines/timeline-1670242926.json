[br]That's what was important.\n...\n..\n.\nI didn't have many friends growing up.\nMy parents were big shots in the automobile industry, or so I had been told. [pause=0.5][br]I was never really able to understand what exactly they were doing when I was young.\nLater I realized that the definition for \"automobile industry\" was seriously stretched in their case.\nI met Apple at one of the factories my parents owned.\nStanding between metal parts I knew immediately that we were going to be friends.\nWhen you grow up as the son of a weapon's manufacturer mogul, you don't really get to enjoy the same benefits as other children your age. \nUnlike many other manufacturers, my father refused to supply what he considered the \"enemy\" with the same weapons as the countries he considered \"us\".\nAnd thus, he was the target of the \"enemy\" faction. \nAnd thus, we were the target of the \"enemy\" faction.\nAs the war went on, I had to be homeschooled in a safe environment. There weren't many children in the same situation as me, my father made sure to not employ anyone with children.\nBut there was one. \nApple was my friend. She studied with me, she played with me, she watched anime with me. \nWe were inseparable, so much so my father arranged for her family to live in the same location I hid out in.\nAnd so we spent our life together. \nAnd so we spent our end together.\nWhen we became adults, we decided to become soldiers. \nOur parents were moved to tears. In their eyes, we were walking a blessed path for our country.\nWe didn't know anything else.\nDuring training, I met the first boys my age. Having gown up mostly around my mother and Apple for the formative years of my life, I quickly realized I wouldn't fit in.\nEven when deploying to the battlefield, I still felt out of place among the male members of our squadron. \nBut at least Apple had been there. We had each other.\n...\n..\n."
